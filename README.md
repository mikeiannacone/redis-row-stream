# Send a stream of items to redis

This module will take in objects or strings as a [stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html), and send it to redis for storage, with a key of some specified prefix, then some index, such as "prefix:0".

## Install

npm install redis-row-stream


## Configuration


## Usage


## Development

If you are going to do development, you may want to use the [git pre-commit hook](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks), which will check the `regex-stream.js` file using [jshint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint) script (if you have it installed) and run the [mocha](visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) tests (mocha is in the git repo). If either of these fail, the commit wont work. To use the hook, from project directory, run:

    ln -s ../../pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
