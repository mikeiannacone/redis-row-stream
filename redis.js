  Send data to redis to persist in the database
  Data sent to redis:
    key-> sensorType:destip where ip is the destination ip (or only ip if not flow)
    value-> {timestamp: event}
  This assumes that for each sensor/ip pair there is only a single timestamp, which may not be the case. May have to have a sequencer or random number here.
  It may be useful instead to have timestamp as part of the key: sensor:destip:timestamp
